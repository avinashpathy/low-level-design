## What is OOP? 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain:

- Data in the form of fields (also called attributes or properties)

- Code in the form of methods (also called functions or behaviors)

- C++ is both a procedural and object-oriented language — perfect for transitioning into OOP.

## Goals of OOP 
- Modularity: Break program into smaller chunks
- Reusability: Write once, use many times

- Scalability: Add more features with ease

- Maintainability: Easier to fix and upgrade

- Abstraction: Hide complexity

- Encapsulation: Wrap data and behavior into one unit (class)

Four Pillars of OOP 
- Encapsulation: Bundling data and functions that operate on the data.

- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.

- Inheritance: Acquiring properties and behaviors from another class.

- Polymorphism: Many forms — functions behave differently based on input/context.

## Basic OOP Terms

| Term        | Description                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Class**   | Blueprint for creating objects         |
| **Object**  | Instance of a class                    |
| **Attribute** | Data inside a class (a.k.a. data member) |
| **Method**  | Function inside a class                |
| **Constructor** | Special method to initialize an object |
| **Destructor**  | Cleans up when object goes out of scope |


## Why OOP over Procedural Programming?

### Procedural Example:

```cpp
int speed = 80;
void accelerate() {
    speed += 10;
}
```
- This exposes speed to outside code, which can be modified recklessly.
There are no rules or restrictions — anyone can change it anytime.

## OOP Encapsulation Example:
```
class Car {
private:
    int speed;

public:
    Car() { speed = 0; }

    void accelerate() { speed += 10; }
    int getSpeed() { return speed; }
};
```

Here, speed is protected and can only be modified via class methods —
this is encapsulation, one of the core principles of OOP.


## Real-World Analogy
Class = Blueprint of a House \
Object = Actual house built from that blueprint \
Each house has:\
- Properties: color, rooms
- Actions: openDoor(), lockDoor()
